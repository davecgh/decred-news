# Contributing to Decred Journal

## Submit Your Story for Next DJ

As Decred and wider cryptocurrency ecosystems are expanding it becomes hard to track all important events. You can help DJ to capture more relevant stories by submitting them on GitHub. To do that, open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues), find one for the [next release](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/labels/next%20release) (e.g. "DJ July 2020") and comment with a link and a short description for the story.

There are many other ways to contribute. Below are just some ideas.

## Feedback

Feedback is a contribution too!

- comment on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/search?q=decred+journal&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)

You don't need great writing skills to contribute. Collection of content, fact checking, fixing typos and improvement ideas are all needed. Those who are good with words can polish the text prior to the release.
