# Contributing to DJ

## Submit your story for next DJ

As Decred and wider cryptocurrency ecosystems are expanding it becomes hard to track all important events. You can help DJ to capture more relevant stories by submitting them on GitHub. To do that, find an issue for the [next release](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/labels/next%20release) (e.g. "DJ July 2020") and comment with a link and a short description for the story.

There are many other ways to contribute. Below are just some ideas.

## Feedback

Feedback is a contribution too!

- comment on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/search?q=decred+journal&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)
- comment in #writers room via [Matrix](https://chat.decred.org/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/GJ2GXfz)
- comment on existing GitHub [issues](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues) or submit new ideas how to improve DJ

## Collecting and writing

Read DJ [Production Guidelines](guidelines.md) to learn how it is produced currently.

You don't need great writing skills to contribute. Collection of content, fact checking, fixing typos and improvement ideas are all needed.

- Development
  - expose dev work: watch projects and submit notable updates
  - extract updates from devs
  - translate technical jargon to English, explain end user benefits
- People
  - make People section more interesting
  - track non-dev contributors
- Network
  - automate collection of stats (see items tagged #automate in the [content plan](content.md))
  - write about interesting events in the network
- Integrations
  - write up key/interesting features/events of mentioned exchanges, wallets and payment processors
- Events
  - dig interesting highlights for past and upcoming events
- Community Discussions
  - report best quality conversations from Twitter, Reddit, etc
- Markets
  - an active trader "in the field" could tell interesting stories from the market
- look for awesome pics and photos of the month
- automate generation of Medium version (see [issue 51](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/51))
- add more content, see [this map](content.md) of current and possible content

## Editing

- Find factual errors
- Attitude: check that nothing damages Decred's public image
- Grammar errors, punctuation, wording, tense consistency, sentence and paragraph composition
- Make the language less boring
- Proportion: check that more important stories get more space
- Order of content
- Help develop a manual of style

## Decentralize!

Since @bee felt a bit [tired](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201903.html#psa-decred-journal-takes-a-break) in April 2019 we made progress to make the production of DJ well [documented](guidelines.md) and [share](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/65) the load. However, it still depends on a handful of people.

You can help to make DJ more resilient by learning how it is made.

## Translating

Translations help to spread the word. DJ is lucky to have [so many](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) translations already, but much more is possible. See [Translating DJ](translating.md) for directions.

## General

Even if you cannot do anything listed above, you might have friends who can.
