{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: {month}'s [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

Distribution of 1,000 blocks [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.
