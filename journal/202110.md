## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Merged changes:

- updating of indexes (transaction, address, exists address) has been made [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) to speed up the critical path of block validation and connection code { any other big picture or fun stuff to mention? and does it help multipeer downloads? }
- simplified to use only one latest [checkpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2763), since intermediate checkpoints are no longer necessary with headers-first syncing { any impact on end users to mention, e.g. any perf gains? also, is [2555](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555) the best link for "headers-first" sync in dcrd? }
- improved consistency and clarity of `txscript` package [tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2757)
- fixed handling of automatic ticket revocations when their block is [disconnected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2768) { is this for reorg handling? }
- fixed a data [race](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2758) in peer address management
- fixed [`findcheckpoint`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2759) and [`addblock`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2760) tools
- [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) support has been added to dcrd's [continuous fuzzing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) test suite

@rstaudt2 [shared](https://twitter.com/rstaudt2/status/1443956206473711617) and educational thread about what "UTXO cache" is, how Decred's implementation compares to Bitcoin Core's, and how it will be key to improving sync performance in the upcoming v1.7. { dead link, maybe drop }

As of Nov 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 733,772 DCR (82.5 million USD at $112.42).

One [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/c1f5b5c) was submitted this month, @ammarooni returns with a proposal that revises an earlier book [proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/9e1d644) to remove the book in favor of a steady stream of papers and social media content, memes and meetups.

**Hashrate**: October's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

Notable features are the orb-shaped eyeball scanners, reminiscent of dystopian science fiction, and the 20% VC premine.

The latest DeFi airdrop farming [controversy](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/08/airdrop-ethics-vc-firm-draws-ire-following-25m-ribbon-finance-exploit/) concerns Ribbon Finance, where one researcher from Divergence Ventures successfully met the qualifying criteria with hundreds of different wallets, and received tokens worth $2.5 million. An independent researcher noticed the pattern and identified the wallet owner through association with an ENS domain, they [suggested](https://twitter.com/gabagooldoteth/status/1446498569603756033) copytrading them on twitter, but it blew up and Divergence Ventures ended up giving back all the airdropped tokens. 

Cream Finance has been [hacked](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) for $130 million, which is the second major hack in the last 3 months. This attack used a flash loan to repeatedly lend and borrow funds across two addresses, and took advantage of a pricing vulnerability to drain many of Cream's liquidity pools. [Analysis](https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/) by a DeFi insider suggests that this hack was executed by a skilled DeFi developer, likely working on a rival project. The attacker also left a cryptic message which appeared to taunt a list of projects and blame yearn developers, and some DeFi developers have started referring to a "[war](https://decrypt.co/84840/behind-defi-war-words-aave-yearn)" in their tweets.

The DeFi protocol Indexed Finance was [hacked](https://decrypt.co/83681/defi-protocol-indexed-finance-hacked-for-16-million-team-finds-hacker) for $16 million, but [identified](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) the attacker. The [story](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) of how the attacker was identified is an interesting one, involving an edit to Wikipedia which they made to describe themselves as a "notable mathematician". It subsequently transpired that the attacker is a [teenager](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts/), and rather than hand the funds back, or 90%, they have decided to test the "code is law" conjecture in court to see if they can keep their flash loan bounty.

The Creature Toadz NFT community was [scammed](https://cryptobriefing.com/hacker-admits-to-stealing-88-eth-then-returns-it/) by an attacker who posted a fake minting link in their Discord - in the 45 minutes before it was taken down 88 ETH was sent to the attacker. The funds were quickly returned after the hacker's identity was discovered.

The infamous $1 trillion infrastructure bill has returned to the house of representatives and someone has discovered an even more egregious anti-crypto provision: [6050I](https://unchainedpodcast.com/not-reporting-info-on-some-transaction-partners-could-soon-be-a-felony/). This provision would require recipients of digital assets to, in many cases, collect a variety of information about the sender and report this to the IRS within 15 days. This provision has only recently been discovered, but it is [apparently](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1456275741398683648) already too late to do anything about amending the infrastructure bill on its passage through the house of representatives.

The latest crypto [fad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tungsten-cubes-bitcoin-gamestop-crypto-investors-11635431036) is not a new blockchain but small blocks of tungsten, which people are buying to touch and hold. It didn't take long for someone to come up with a [Tungsten DAO](https://twitter.com/tungsten_dao) which has minted an NFT representing a very large block of tungsten, and [sold](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest) this for $250,000, to a holder who is entitled to visit it once a year for looking and touching (it's too heavy to hold, or deliver).
