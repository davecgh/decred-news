## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Merged changes:

- updating of indexes (transaction, address, exists address) has been made [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) to speed up the critical path of block validation and connection code { any other big picture or fun stuff to mention? and does it help multipeer downloads? }
- simplified to use only one latest [checkpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2763), since intermediate checkpoints are no longer necessary with headers-first syncing { any impact on end users to mention, e.g. any perf gains? also, is [2555](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555) the best link for "headers-first" sync in dcrd? }
- improved consistency and clarity of `txscript` package [tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2757)
- fixed handling of automatic ticket revocations when their block is [disconnected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2768) { is this for reorg handling? }
- fixed a data [race](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2758) in peer address management
- fixed [`findcheckpoint`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2759) and [`addblock`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2760) tools
- [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) support has been added to dcrd's [continuous fuzzing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) test suite

@rstaudt2 [shared](https://twitter.com/rstaudt2/status/1443956206473711617) and educational thread about what "UTXO cache" is, how Decred's implementation compares to Bitcoin Core's, and how it will be key to improving sync performance in the upcoming v1.7. { dead link, maybe drop }

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

_dcrwallet is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet applications._

- implemented [`getblockheader`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2098) and [`getcurrentnet`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2102) methods in SPV mode (to be used by DCRDEX)
- added [`spv`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2094) field to `walletinfo` result to distinguish between syncing modes
- fixed [sync loss](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2099) in SPV mode

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

User-facing changes:

- implemented new UI design on [LN Overview](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3551) tab. Wallet, Network, and Watchtowers tabs have been grouped under a newly introduced Advanced tab.
- new UI design for wallet [modals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3534) with added password visibility toggle
- added the ability to use [random VSP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3560) in Automatic Ticket Purchases (with a configurable maximum fee)
- enable the new [per-account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3579) encryption for new wallets
- improved usability of the [VSP selector](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3563)
- fixed inability to [copy](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3564) unspent output hash
- ~12 bug fixes

Internal:

- updated DEX integration via [libdexc](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3549) to utilize upcoming 0.3 features (localized UI, restore from seed, and discovery of existing accounts)
- updated to [Electron v15](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3571)
- added a new GUI tool for [translating](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3569) strings and a [guide](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/community_translators.md) for community translators
- automated tests for [Accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3577) views

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

_Politeia is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

User-facing changes:

- added standard way to show any status change reason (not only censored but now also abandoned and closed)
- improved [identity error](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2623) messages
- support [multiple](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2629) billing status changes. Ideally there should be only one (from Active to Completed or Closed), but this allows to correct admin mistakes. It is also possible to temporarily [disable](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1533) status changes.
- fixed inability to [comment](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1546) on unvetted proposals
- ~13 other bug fixes

Changes in `politeiavoter` command-line tool:

- changed [trickling](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1556) method (trickling is slow sending of votes). Previously it has sent votes in a sequence with random time intervals. This has proven to be brittle as one slow/failed send was delaying all other votes. New method uses independent parallel voting processes that start at random times and do not affect each other, making trickling more robust.
- added an option to abort if vote trickling cannot finish with enough [extra time](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1542) before the vote end. It alarms the user to adjust parameters so that enough time (12 hours by default) is left to retry any failed votes, which may happen over poor connections or Tor.
- brought back printing of proposal [names](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1548) in `inventory` command

Backend and internal changes:

- added API to get billing [status changes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1526)
- allow to fetch billing status changes [in batches](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1535)
- use response [page size](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2622) received from the server
- added data integrity checks for [`ticketvote`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1531) and [`comments`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1544) plugins
- added a new `pictl` command to test the [RFP flow](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1551)
- ~4 bug fixes

Refactoring in preparation for the [user layer rewrite](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1479) { this is the master issue, correct? } (largest chunk of work for the [2021 Q3](https://proposals.decred.org/record/91cfcc8) proposal):

- politeiawww codebase reorganized to move legacy APIs into a [`legacy`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1523) package. This will make it easier to rewrite the user layer to use a plugin architecture and to allow for horizontal scaling.
- extracted [`logger`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1527) package to allow plugins configure their logging and become self-contained
- extracted [`websockets`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1529) package (will make it easier to scale the servers)
- extracted [config](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1536) handling into its own package and separated out settings for legacy API for easier removal in the future
- moved [identity](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1530) handling methods to more appropriate places
- added a generic [session store](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1555) (will replace the [legacy](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1554) one that did not have proper separation of concerns)

{ image candidates: maybe [2625](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2625), or skip this time }

<a id="vspd" />

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

_vspd is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- updated to latest [dcrd RPC](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/297) version. Since this commit, vspd will stop working against dcrd v1.6 and start to target the `master` branch.
- allow setting an [alternative](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/287) signing address to support VSP staking with Trezor

<a id="dcrlnd" />

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

_dcrlnd is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- perform account discovery only [once](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/145) for embedded wallets (not applicable to remote wallets that are controlled externally)
- improved [quickstart](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/146) docs and added a new doc summarizing the 4 [operation modes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/operation_modes.md) (dcrd or SPV sync, remote or embedded wallet)

Notable features are the orb-shaped eyeball scanners, reminiscent of dystopian science fiction, and the 20% VC premine.

The latest DeFi airdrop farming [controversy](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/08/airdrop-ethics-vc-firm-draws-ire-following-25m-ribbon-finance-exploit/) concerns Ribbon Finance, where one researcher from Divergence Ventures successfully met the qualifying criteria with hundreds of different wallets, and received tokens worth $2.5 million. An independent researcher noticed the pattern and identified the wallet owner through association with an ENS domain, they [suggested](https://twitter.com/gabagooldoteth/status/1446498569603756033) copytrading them on twitter, but it blew up and Divergence Ventures ended up giving back all the airdropped tokens. 

Cream Finance has been [hacked](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) for $130 million, which is the second major hack in the last 3 months. This attack used a flash loan to repeatedly lend and borrow funds across two addresses, and took advantage of a pricing vulnerability to drain many of Cream's liquidity pools. [Analysis](https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/) by a DeFi insider suggests that this hack was executed by a skilled DeFi developer, likely working on a rival project. The attacker also left a cryptic message which appeared to taunt a list of projects and blame yearn developers, and some DeFi developers have started referring to a "[war](https://decrypt.co/84840/behind-defi-war-words-aave-yearn)" in their tweets.

The DeFi protocol Indexed Finance was [hacked](https://decrypt.co/83681/defi-protocol-indexed-finance-hacked-for-16-million-team-finds-hacker) for $16 million, but [identified](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) the attacker. The [story](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) of how the attacker was identified is an interesting one, involving an edit to Wikipedia which they made to describe themselves as a "notable mathematician". It subsequently transpired that the attacker is a [teenager](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts/), and rather than hand the funds back, or 90%, they have decided to test the "code is law" conjecture in court to see if they can keep their flash loan bounty.

The Creature Toadz NFT community was [scammed](https://cryptobriefing.com/hacker-admits-to-stealing-88-eth-then-returns-it/) by an attacker who posted a fake minting link in their Discord - in the 45 minutes before it was taken down 88 ETH was sent to the attacker.

The infamous $1 trillion infrastructure bill has returned to the house of representatives and someone has discovered an even more egregious anti-crypto provision: [6050I](https://unchainedpodcast.com/not-reporting-info-on-some-transaction-partners-could-soon-be-a-felony/). This provision would require recipients of digital assets to, in many cases, collect a variety of information about the sender and report this to the IRS within 15 days. This provision has only recently been discovered, but it is [apparently](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1456275741398683648) already too late to do anything about amending the infrastructure bill on its passage through the house of representatives.

The latest crypto [fad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tungsten-cubes-bitcoin-gamestop-crypto-investors-11635431036) is not a new blockchain but small blocks of tungsten, which people are buying to touch and hold. It didn't take long for someone to come up with a [Tungsten DAO](https://twitter.com/tungsten_dao) which has minted an NFT representing a very large block of tungsten, and [sold](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest) this for $250,000, to a holder who is entitled to visit it once a year for looking and touching (it's too heavy to hold, or deliver).
