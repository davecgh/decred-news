## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Merged changes:

- updating of indexes (transaction, address, exists address) has been made [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) to speed up the critical path of block validation and connection code. It allows for faster vote propagation and helps pave the way for other optimizations, sync models, and ultimately nicer data corruption recovery mechanisms.
- simplified to use only one latest [checkpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2763), since intermediate checkpoints are no longer necessary with [headers-first syncing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555)
- improved consistency and clarity of `txscript` package [tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2757)
- fixed handling of automatic ticket revocations when their block is [disconnected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2768) during a chain reorganization
- fixed a data [race](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2758) in peer address management
- fixed [`findcheckpoint`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2759) and [`addblock`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2760) tools
- [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) support has been added to dcrd's [continuous fuzzing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) test suite

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

_dcrwallet is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet applications._

- implemented [`getblockheader`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2098) and [`getcurrentnet`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2102) methods in SPV mode (to be used by DCRDEX)
- added [`spv`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2094) field to `walletinfo` result to distinguish between syncing modes
- fixed [sync loss](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2099) in SPV mode

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

User-facing changes:

- implemented new UI design on [LN Overview](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3551) tab. Wallet, Network, and Watchtowers tabs have been grouped under a newly introduced Advanced tab.
- new UI design for wallet [modals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3534) with added password visibility toggle
- added the ability to use [random VSP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3560) in Automatic Ticket Purchases (with a configurable maximum fee)
- automaticalle enable the new [per-account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3579) encryption for new wallets
- improved usability of the [VSP selector](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3563)
- ~13 bug fixes

Internal:

- updated DEX integration via [libdexc](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3549) to utilize upcoming 0.3 features (localized UI, restore from seed, and discovery of existing accounts)
- updated to [Electron 15](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3571)
- added a new GUI tool for [translating](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3569) strings and a [guide](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/community_translators.md) for community translators
- automated tests for [Accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3577) views

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

_Politeia is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

User-facing changes:

- added a standard way to show any status change. Admin that censored or abandoned the proposal is displayed along with the reason they gave for the status change.
- support [multiple](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2629) billing status changes. The default is to only allow a single billing status change (from Active to Completed or Closed), but it is a configurable setting. If an admin makes a mistake, the sysadmin can temporarily update the setting to allow for the mistake to be corrected. It is also possible to temporarily [disable](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1533) status changes.
- improved and standardized the [identity error](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2623). The same error is now displayed anytime the user attempts to write data to Politeia without their active identity being loaded in the browser. The error message directs to user details page to fix the issue.
- fixed multiple [comment navigation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2638) UX issues: filtering preferences being lost, Go Back button not working properly, slow loading of individual threads, UI flickering
- ~5 other bug fixes

Changes in `politeiavoter` command-line tool:

- changed [trickling](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1556) method (trickling is slow sending of votes). Previously it has sent votes in a sequence with random time intervals. This has proven to be brittle as one slow/failed send was delaying all other votes. New method uses independent parallel voting processes that start at random times and do not affect each other, making trickling more robust.
- added an option to abort if vote trickling cannot finish with enough [extra time](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1542) before the vote end. It alarms the user to adjust parameters so that enough time (12 hours by default) is left to retry any failed votes, which may happen over poor connections or Tor.
- brought back printing of proposal [names](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1548) in `inventory` command

Backend and internal changes:

- added API to get billing [status changes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1526)
- allow to fetch billing status changes [in batches](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1535)
- use the server policy for [page size](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2622)
- added data integrity checks for [`ticketvote`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1531) and [`comments`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1544) plugins
- added a new `pictl` command to test the [RFP flow](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1551)
- ~4 bug fixes

Refactoring in preparation for the [user layer rewrite](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1479) { this is the master issue, correct? } (largest chunk of work for the [2021 Q3](https://proposals.decred.org/record/91cfcc8) proposal):

- politeiawww codebase reorganized to move legacy APIs into a [`legacy`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1523) package. This will make it easier to rewrite the user layer to use a plugin architecture and to allow for horizontal scaling.
- extracted [`logger`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1527) package to allow plugins configure their logging and become self-contained
- extracted [`websockets`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1529) package (will make it easier to scale the servers)
- extracted [config](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1536) handling into its own package and separated out settings for legacy API for easier removal in the future
- moved [identity](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1530) handling methods to more appropriate places
- added a generic [session store](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1555) (will replace the [legacy](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1554) one that did not have proper separation of concerns)

<a id="vspd" />

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

_vspd is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- updated to latest [dcrd RPC](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/297) version. Since this commit, vspd will stop working against dcrd v1.6 and start to target the `master` branch.
- allow setting an [alternative](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/287) signing address to support VSP staking with Trezor

<a id="dcrlnd" />

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

_dcrlnd is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- perform account discovery only [once](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/145) for embedded wallets (not applicable to remote wallets that are controlled externally)
- improved [quickstart](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/146) docs and added a new doc summarizing the 4 [operation modes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/operation_modes.md) (dcrd or SPV sync, remote or embedded wallet)

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

_DCRDEX is a non-custodial exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

User-facing changes:

- reworked register flow to accept [assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1223) other than DCR

- improved [registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1234) sequence and form design/animations
- added [Bitcoin SPV](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1230) support to trade against BTC without managing a full Bitcoin blockchain. Built on top of [Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) and [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) (_old investment paying off!_).
- start BTC SPV wallet [scan](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1249) from a certain date to save time
- require ["zpub"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1255) extended public keys but offer to convert from "xpub" for convenience. This is for server operators willing to accept registration fees in BTC.
- ~6 bug fixes

Internal changes:

- support multiple [HD accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1210) for same DEX seed, to allow registering additional accounts after initial account is suspended. This change also retires legacy accounts with random keys to ensure all new accounts can be derived from app seed.
- refactored client DCR backend to support alternative [wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1227) implementations. This will be used to integrate DCRDEX into GoDCR.

Progress towards Ethereum support:

- implemented several [backend methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1154) ([swap](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1218) and [redeem](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1219) estimations, order [funding](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1221), message [signing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1228), and more)
- added function to initiate a [batch](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1251) of multiple swaps in the same transaction (saves gas)
- [derive](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1225) the internal Ethereum wallet from app seed

## Governance

In October the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,678 DCR worth $1.3 Million at the month's average rate of $121.57. 974 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $118K at October's rate, or $136K at September's billing rate of $139.56. As of Nov 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 733,772 DCR (82.5 million USD at $112.42).

One [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/c1f5b5c) was submitted this month, @ammarooni returns with a proposal that revises an earlier book [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/9e1d644) to remove the book in favor of a steady stream of papers and social media content, memes and meetups. 

The two proposals from @raedah were voted on this month, the [one](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e) for mobile wallets was approved with 97.2% yes votes and 66% turnout, while the [proposal](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/proposal/f7d9fc852e309b31) to continue funding GoDCR was rejected with 49% approval and turnout of 73%.

See Politeia Digest [issue 47](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue047/) and [issue 48](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue048/) for more details on the month's proposals.


## Network

**Hashrate**: October's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~237 Ph/s and closed ~284 Ph/s, bottoming at 164 Ph/s and peaking at 323 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Nov 1: F2Pool 50%, AntPool 17%, BTC.com 11%, Luxor 10%, ViaBTC 10%, HuobiPool 0.8%, OKEx 0.6%, CoinMine 0.3%. 29% is unknown. { unknown computes to 0.3%, and it differs a lot from mined blocks. please verify }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by Nov 1: Poolin 42%, F2Pool 31%, Antpool 9%, BTC.com 7%, Luxor 5%, ViaBTC 5%, OKEx 0.7%, unknown 0.3%.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 139.7-209.7 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 191.6 DCR (-7.8).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.65-8.20 million DCR, meaning that 56.7-61.1% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ image: dcrdata stake% shot }

**VSP**: On Nov 1, ~7,400 (-200) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and 224 (+4) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 7 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed ~23.4% (+4.4%) of the ticket pool. { to be 23.4%, the ~7600 tix must have a pool size of ~32,500 - verify }

**Nodes**: Throughout October there were around 200 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Nov 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (245 total, dcrd only): v1.6.2 - 59%, v1.7 dev builds - 13%, v1.6.0 - 12%, v1.6.1 - 9%, v1.6 dev builds - 3%, v1.5.2 - 2%, v1.5.1 - 0.8%.

The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q3lq8-l0s732o6&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between 52.3-54.4% and set a new all-time high with the sum of mixed unspent coins above 7.3 million.

An independent researcher noticed the pattern and identified the wallet owner through association with an ENS domain, they [suggested](https://twitter.com/gabagooldoteth/status/1446498569603756033) copytrading them on twitter, but it blew up and Divergence Ventures ended up giving back all the airdropped tokens. 

Cream Finance has been [hacked](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) for $130 million, which is the second major hack in the last 3 months. This attack used a flash loan to repeatedly lend and borrow funds across two addresses, and took advantage of a pricing vulnerability to drain many of Cream's liquidity pools. [Analysis](https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/) by a DeFi insider suggests that this hack was executed by a skilled DeFi developer, likely working on a rival project. The attacker also left a cryptic message which appeared to taunt a list of projects and blame yearn developers, and some DeFi developers have started referring to a "[war](https://decrypt.co/84840/behind-defi-war-words-aave-yearn)" in their tweets.

The DeFi protocol Indexed Finance was [hacked](https://decrypt.co/83681/defi-protocol-indexed-finance-hacked-for-16-million-team-finds-hacker) for $16 million, but [identified](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) the attacker. The [story](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) of how the attacker was identified is an interesting one, involving an edit to Wikipedia which they made to describe themselves as a "notable mathematician". It subsequently transpired that the attacker is a [teenager](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts/), and rather than hand the funds back, or 90%, they have decided to test the "code is law" conjecture in court to see if they can keep their flash loan bounty.

The Creature Toadz NFT community was [scammed](https://cryptobriefing.com/hacker-admits-to-stealing-88-eth-then-returns-it/) by an attacker who posted a fake minting link in their Discord - in the 45 minutes before it was taken down 88 ETH was sent to the attacker.

The infamous $1 trillion infrastructure bill has returned to the house of representatives and someone has discovered an even more egregious anti-crypto provision: [6050I](https://unchainedpodcast.com/not-reporting-info-on-some-transaction-partners-could-soon-be-a-felony/). This provision would require recipients of digital assets to, in many cases, collect a variety of information about the sender and report this to the IRS within 15 days. This provision has only recently been discovered, but it is [apparently](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1456275741398683648) already too late to do anything about amending the infrastructure bill on its passage through the house of representatives.

The latest crypto [fad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tungsten-cubes-bitcoin-gamestop-crypto-investors-11635431036) is not a new blockchain but small blocks of tungsten, which people are buying to touch and hold. It didn't take long for someone to come up with a [Tungsten DAO](https://twitter.com/tungsten_dao) which has minted an NFT representing a very large block of tungsten, and [sold](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest) this for $250,000, to a holder who is entitled to visit it once a year for looking and touching (it's too heavy to hold, or deliver).

That's all for October. Share your updates for the next issue in our [#journal](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#journal:decred.org) chat room.
