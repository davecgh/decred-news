## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Code implementing the [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) consensus change has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680) (after some [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2679) to make the actual change easier to review). With this change, treasury spend limit will be based on its historical income and not expense, which in turn unlocks the ability to use the new decentralized treasury.

Merged work towards the [Automatic Ticket Revocations](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) consensus change:

- added a method to get all tickets that [will expire](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2701) in the next block
- unified vote and revocation [validation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2702)
- added a function to create [revocation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2707) tx for a given ticket

Other merged work:

- optimized [precomputed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2690) math values for ~10% faster signature verification and ~400 KiB smaller `dcrd` binary
- rewritten [NAF conversion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2695) to avoid all heap allocations and switch to a faster algorithm, removing another ~1% from signature verification time { mention memory usage changes? }
- added methods to create and restore [snapshots](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2715) of spendable coinbase outputs (will allow more efficient tests)
- added config option for maximum [log file](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2711) size before it is rotated and compressed


<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

{ are JSON-RPC API additions/changes automatically reflected in `dcrctl` CLI? }

- added mixing and VSP support to [`purchaseticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2064) JSON-RPC request
- added [`processunmanagedticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2075) JSON-RPC request to assign an existing ticket to the configured VSP
- added [storing](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2068) of VSP host and public key for each ticket in the wallet database (this will allow to skip redundant checking of ticket fee status)
- fixed some duplicate address [watching](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2076) (it was bottlenecking block processing on heavily-used wallets)
- fixed some [hangs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2081) when locking or shutting down the wallet
- fixed and improved [reorg handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2084) in SPV syncing mode

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- added a button to [revoke](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3506) tickets while in SPV mode
- replaced the gap limit setting with a [Discover Address Usage](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3532) one-time action with its own gap limit
- new UI design for [LN Send](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3538) page
- new UI design for [LN Receive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3537) page

{ UI shot maybe }

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

Politeia v1.1.0 has been released and deployed at [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/). Release highlights:

- proposal authors are now required to fill funding amount, start and end dates, and the domain when submitting proposals (recent proposals like [this](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) show this new data at the top)
- [combined](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2431) `In Discussion` and `Voting` tabs into one `Under Review` tab to help users quickly see if any proposals are being voted on
- ability to see raw Markdown
- ability to see who censored the proposal and why
- many UI/UX fixes and improvements
- email notifications are now rate limited to prevent malicious users from triggering too many of them and getting Politeia server flagged as a source of spam
- user database moved to MySQL which allows to remove CockroachDB as a dependency and have only one database instance to manage

For more details check the release notes in [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and [politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/releases/tag/v1.1.0) repositories.

User-facing changes merged in master (post v1.1.0):

- allow user to [compare](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2524) any two proposal versions
- highlight comment [votes](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2520) immediately but show an error if server request failed
- ~7 bug fixes

Backend, internal, and command-line changes merged:

- verify [password](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1490) before expensive wallet operations in `politeiavoter vote` command
- human-readable [currency](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1488) values in `pictl` tool output (e.g. when submitting new proposals with it)
- added CSRF protection to the [login](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1481) route
- added [billing statuses](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1480) (Active, Closed, Completed) to mark whether an approved proposal can or cannot be billed against
- require the [extra data](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1487) fields to be signed when posting or editing comments, and only allow that data if configured in the comments plugin (the purpose of these fields is to extend the comments plugin with new functionality)
- allow proposal authors to post [updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1491) on approved proposals. Each update starts a new comment thread where users can reply and vote, until an admin marks the proposal as either Completed or Closed.
- increased test coverage

<a id="vspd" />

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- ported [signal](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/293) handling improvements from other projects
- smaller fixes and maintenance

<a id="dcrlnd" />

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- updated to [latest](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/138) dcrd and dcrwallet
- added a [script](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/139) to build a simulation network for testing
- added [SPV support](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/140) in embedded wallet mode

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

User-facing:

- overhauled client [credentials](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1015) system. Private keys for each new DEX account are now derived from a single app seed and server's public key. Also, the single app password used to encrypt sensitive user data is replaced with an inner key, itself encrypted by an outer key. This removes the need to re-encrypt all protected data when the password is changed.
- added an endpoint to return [app seed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1149) if supplied the correct app password
- added a checkbox to [remember password](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1119) for the duration of the session
- make user aware of available markets and lot sizes before [registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1135) fee is paid
- allow clients to [cancel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1133) orders while a market is suspended
- fixed [scrolling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1142) issues

{ UI shot candidates: 1135 }

Internal:

- use [compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/954) on the client to locate counterparty contract redemptions instead of always pulling blocks to check
- do not broadcast swaps if there's any trouble generating or signing the [refund tx](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1166)
- initial [internationalization](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1051) support on the client (in Go, HTML and JS code)
- check if [localized](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1167) templates need updating when building
- fixed some shutdown [hangs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1150)
- fixed and improved [reorg testing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/669)

Ethereum support:

- initial version of the Solidity [smart contract](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1019) for ETH swaps. As the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/a7046c670b4f824b7b5e237c9efcecbd8fc5e604/dex/networks/eth/contracts) says, it is untested and unsafe for use on mainnet and is intended as a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept#Software_development) of ETH swaps. This PR generated a lot of knowledge about Ethereum and contract security, and brought in [code](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/a7046c670b4f824b7b5e237c9efcecbd8fc5e604/client/asset/eth/rpcclient_harness_test.go#L706) testing for reentry attack vulnerability.
- approximate swap [gas cost](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1157)

Some changes have been backported to the [v0.2.x](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/release-v0.2) release branch.

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and {} (-{}) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed {}% of the ticket pool.

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.
