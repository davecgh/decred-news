## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Implementation of the [Revert Treasury Expenditure Policy](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) consensus change (DCP-7) has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680) (following some [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2679) to make the it easier to review). If the vote passes, spend limit will be based on treasury's historical income and not its historical spends, which in turn unlocks the ability to use the new decentralized treasury.

Merged work towards the [Automatic Ticket Revocations](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki) consensus change (DCP-9):

- added a method to get all tickets that [will expire](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2701) in the next block
- unified vote and revocation [validation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2702)
- added a function to create [revocation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2707) tx for a given ticket

Other merged work:

- optimized [precomputed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2690) math values for ~10% faster signature verification and ~400 KiB smaller `dcrd` binary
- rewritten [NAF conversion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2695) to avoid all heap allocations and switch to a faster algorithm, removing another ~1% from signature verification time
  - { maybe mention memory savings too? if yes, how to present "alloc(s)/op" in the benchmark? }
- added methods to create and restore [snapshots](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2715) of spendable coinbase outputs (will allow more efficient tests)
- added config option for maximum [log file](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2711) size before it is rotated and compressed


<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

{ are JSON-RPC API additions/changes automatically propagated to `dcrctl` CLI? }

- added mixing and VSP support to [`purchaseticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2064) JSON-RPC request
- added [`processunmanagedticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2075) JSON-RPC request to assign an existing ticket to the VSP configured in user's config file
- added [storing](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2068) of VSP host and public key for each ticket in the wallet database (allows more efficient checking of ticket fee status)
- fixed some duplicate address [watching](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2076) (it was bottlenecking block processing on heavily-used wallets)
- fixed some [hangs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2081) when locking or shutting down the wallet
- fixed and improved [reorg handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2084) in SPV syncing mode

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- added a button to [revoke](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3506) tickets while in SPV mode
- replaced the gap limit setting with one-shot [Discover Address Usage](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3532) action with its own gap limit
- new UI design for [LN Send](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3538) page
- new UI design for [LN Receive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3537) page

{ UI shot candidates: 3537..3538 }

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

Politeia v1.1.0 has been released and deployed at [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/). Release highlights:

- proposal authors are now required to fill funding amount, start and end dates, and the domain when submitting proposals (recent proposals like [this](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) show this new data at the top)
- [combined](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2431) `In Discussion` and `Voting` tabs into one `Under Review` tab to help users quickly see if any proposals are being voted on
- ability to see raw Markdown
- ability to see who censored the proposal and why
- many UI/UX fixes and improvements
- email notifications are now rate limited to prevent malicious users from triggering too many of them and getting Politeia flagged as a spam server
- user database moved to MySQL in order to remove CockroachDB as a dependency and have only one database instance to manage

For more details check the release notes in [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and [politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/releases/tag/v1.1.0) repositories.

User-facing changes merged in master (post v1.1.0):

- allow user to [compare](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2524) any two proposal versions
- highlight comment [votes](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2520) immediately but show an error if server request failed
- ~7 bug fixes

{ check again if there are any UI shot candidates }

Backend, internal, and command-line changes:

- verify [password](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1490) before expensive wallet operations in `politeiavoter vote` command
- human-readable [currency](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1488) values in `pictl` tool output (e.g. when submitting new proposals with it)
- added CSRF protection to the [login](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1481) route
- added [billing statuses](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1480) (Active, Closed, Completed) to mark whether an approved proposal can or cannot be billed against
- require the [extra data](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1487) fields to be signed when posting or editing comments, and only allow that data if configured in the comments plugin (the purpose of these fields is to extend the comments plugin with new functionality)
- allow proposal authors to post [updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1491) on approved proposals. Each update starts a new comment thread where users can reply and vote, until an admin marks the proposal as either Completed or Closed.
- increased test coverage

<a id="vspd" />

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- ported [signal](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/293) handling improvements from other projects
- smaller fixes and maintenance

<a id="dcrlnd" />

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- updated to [latest](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/138) dcrd and dcrwallet
- added a [script](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/139) to generate a simulation network for testing
- added [SPV support](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/140) in embedded wallet mode { how big is this? }

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

User-facing:

- overhauled client [credentials](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1015) system. Private keys for each new DEX account are now derived from a single app seed and server's public key. Also, the single app password used to encrypt sensitive user data is replaced with a pair of keys where "inner" key is encrypted with the "outer" key. This removes the need to re-encrypt all protected data when the password (and the outer key) is changed.
- added an endpoint to return [app seed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1149) if supplied the correct app password
- added a checkbox to [remember password](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1119) for the duration of the session
- make user aware of available markets and lot sizes before [registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1135) fee is paid
- allow clients to [cancel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1133) orders while a market is suspended
- fixed [scrolling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1142) issues

{ UI shot candidates: 1135; (but check one more time) }

Internal:

- use [compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/954) on the client to locate counterparty contract redemptions instead of always pulling blocks to check
- do not broadcast swaps if there's any trouble generating or signing the [refund tx](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1166)
- initial [internationalization](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1051) support on the client (in Go, HTML and JS code)
- automatically check if [localized](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1167) templates need to be regenerated
- fixed some shutdown [hangs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1150)
- fixed and improved [reorg testing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/669)

Ethereum support:

- initial version of the Solidity [smart contract](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1019) for ETH swaps. As the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/a7046c670b4f824b7b5e237c9efcecbd8fc5e604/dex/networks/eth/contracts) says, it is untested and unsafe for use on mainnet and is intended as a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept#Software_development) of ETH swaps. This PR generated a lot of knowledge about Ethereum and contract security, and brought in [code](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/a7046c670b4f824b7b5e237c9efcecbd8fc5e604/client/asset/eth/rpcclient_harness_test.go#L706) testing for reentry attack vulnerability.
- added swap [gas cost](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1157) approximation

Most of these changes are towards the [v0.3 milestone](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/12) but some were backported to the [v0.2.x](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/release-v0.2) release branch.

## Governance

In August the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,942 DCR worth $1.76M at August's average rate of $161.24. 845 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $136K at August's rate, or $108K at July's billing rate of $127.48. As of Sep 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 713,371 DCR (129 million USD at $187.50).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity }

{ high level recap of decision-making activity and most important events }

There were two new proposals published in August, and they have both started voting in early September:

* A third [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) from Monde PR to renew the PR effort by @lindseymmc for another year at a cost of $42,000.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/150cf81) from @finstreet21 to produce a series of educational videos about Decred for the Indian market, at a cost of $9,800 split across three milestones.

The two proposals submitted in July which voted in August were rejected:

* The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae609f1) to fund a documentary by @frizzers at a cost of $295,000 was rejected with 12.5% approval and turnout of 67%.

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.
