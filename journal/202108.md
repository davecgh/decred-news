## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Code implementing the [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) consensus change has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680) (after some [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2679) to make the actual change easier to review). With this change, treasury spend limit will be based on its historical income and not expense, which in turn unlocks the ability to use the new decentralized treasury.

Merged work towards the [Automatic Ticket Revocations](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) consensus change:

- added a method to get all tickets that [will expire](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2701) in the next block
- unified vote and revocation [validation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2702)
- added a function to create [revocation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2707) tx for a given ticket

Other merged work:

- optimized [precomputed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2690) math values for ~10% faster signature verification and ~400 KiB smaller `dcrd` binary
- rewritten [NAF conversion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2695) to avoid all heap allocations and switch to a faster algorithm, removing another ~1% from signature verification time { mention memory usage changes? }
- added methods to create and restore [snapshots](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2715) of spendable coinbase outputs (will allow more efficient tests)
- added config option for maximum [log file](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2711) size before it is rotated and compressed


<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

{ are JSON-RPC API additions/changes automatically reflected in `dcrctl` CLI? }

- added mixing and VSP support to [`purchaseticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2064) JSON-RPC request
- added [`processunmanagedticket`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2075) JSON-RPC request to assign an existing ticket to the configured VSP
- added [storing](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2068) of VSP host and public key for each ticket in the wallet database (this will allow to skip redundant checking of ticket fee status)
- fixed some duplicate address [watching](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2076) (it was bottlenecking block processing on heavily-used wallets)
- fixed some [hangs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2081) when locking or shutting down the wallet
- fixed and improved [reorg handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2084) in SPV syncing mode

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: August's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and {} (-{}) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed {}% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout August there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of {date} [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) ({} total, dcrd only): { vX.Y.Z - n%, ... }

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

Some U.S. lawmakers got surprisingly selective about consensus algorithms and only excluded [proof-of-work mining](https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-backs-crypto-tax-amendment-endorsing-proof-of-work-infrastructure-bill/) from "brokers".
