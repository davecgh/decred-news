## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

{ check if any changes were added between May-28 and May-31 }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- moved code for handling [signing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2642) standard scripts to its own subpackage, in order to prepare for future splitting of standard script handling from consensus critical code
- updated OpenBSD [rc script](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2646) for 6.9 features
- reworked application [version](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2651) handling to parse it from a single string, which is easier to manage and is more error-proof
- perform a graceful shutdown on [SIGHUP](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2645) signal
- added script [version](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2650) to the result of the `gettxout` RPC. The script version is going to become more important in the future when a new version is introduced.
- [flush](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2649) block database to disk before UTXO database to ensure the latter can be recovered after an unclean shutdown
- reworked [UTXO](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2652) related logic for better separation of concerns. This makes the flow easier to follow and paves the way for optimizing the UTXO database

## Governance

{ we need to revise how we report to cover both legacy and new Treasury. maybe just sum them for a start? }

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using May's average of ${n.nn}, this is ${n} received and ${n} spent. At April's average rate of $198.60, the USD billed for past work is ${n}. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: May's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by vspd servers and {} (-{}) by the [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed {}% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout May there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of {date} [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) ({} total, dcrd only): { vX.Y.Z - n%, ... }

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

How exchanges handled Decred's 6th consensus upgrade on May 8:

- Binance had no issues { someone please confirm }
- Bittrex got stuck at block [552447](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/552447) - by coincidence it is the last block on the old consensus rules. Their [status page](https://global.bittrex.com/Status) reported that DCR wallet is disabled and under "Wallet Maintenance" until at least May 13 { update the finish date }.
- Poloniex [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PoloSupport/status/1390916088397852675) that their DCR wallet has been disabled for "maintenance" that lasted until at least May 13 { update the finish date }.
- { did DCRDEX have any downtime? :D }
- { any info on other exchanges? }
