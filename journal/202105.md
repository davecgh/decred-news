## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

{ check if any changes were added between May-28 and May-31 }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- moved code for handling [signing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2642) standard scripts to its own subpackage, in order to prepare for future splitting of standard script handling from consensus critical code
- updated OpenBSD [rc script](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2646) for 6.9 features
- reworked application [version](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2651) handling to parse it from a single string, which is easier to manage and is more error-proof
- perform a graceful shutdown when the [SIGHUP](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2645) signal is received
- added script [version](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2650) to the result of the `gettxout` RPC. The script version is going to become more important in the future when a new version is introduced.
- [flush](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2649) block database to disk before UTXO database to ensure the latter can be recovered after an unclean shutdown
- reworked [UTXO](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2652) related logic for better separation of concerns. This makes the flow easier to follow and paves the way for optimizing the UTXO database

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Merged in master and v1.6.3 release:

- improved heuristic for creating [split transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2034) to address more insufficient balance errors when buying tickets
- fixed [input selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2035) when paying VSP fees, resolving two bugs: one where the intended inputs were not being used and could remaining locked, and another where VSP fee could be paid out of the wrong account, possibly degrading privacy of mixing wallets
- ensure intended wallet [accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2037) are used for paying VSP fee and receiving change when syncing failed VSP tickets { what is a "failed VSP ticket"? }
- [multiple](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2045) [fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2046) for [tracking](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2048) VSP-managed tickets regarding fee payment scheduling, error handling, revocations, and expired fee transactions
- ensure there are [no duplicate](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2042) fee payments and that all are tracked by the VSP client
- perform a graceful shutdown when the [SIGHUP](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2039) signal is received
- a new gRPC endpoint that exposes tickets and fees [tracked](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2040) by the VSP client (needed by Decrediton)

Merged in master:

- implemented [`gettxout`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1903) method returning information about an unspent transaction output, which is required for DCRDEX to operate a DCR wallet in [SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/788)
- implemented [methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1978) to obtain cfilters ([compact block filters](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/compact-block-filters/)) and the best block. These are similar to dcrd's implementations and also enable DCRDEX to manage DCR in SPV mode.

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

Merged in master and v1.6.3 release:

- allow to [send](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3446) funds between accounts in privacy wallets (except into the mixed account)
- only show the "Process Managed Tickets" view when it is [needed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3457)
- fixed blank page being shown on startup instead of a [loading bar](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3449)
- fixed incorrect passphrase allowing to [skip](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3454) account security migration
- fixed wallet account [locking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3453) to prevent the locking of accounts where VSP tickets are being processed, but to also lock any accounts that no longer need to be unlocked
- consistently use Lodash for [type checking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3135)
- { were 3476 and 3469 added to 1.6.3 later? }

{ add release build info here or in v1.6.3 section }

{ see if any interesting changes were not mentioned in 1.6.3 rel notes }

Merged in master:

- fixed unmixed and change accounts not being [unlocked](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3476) when the ticket autobuyer is in privacy mode
- fixed default Bitcoin [directory](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3469) on Windows
- fixed handling of empty value for [balance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3468) to maintain
- introduced [preload script](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3397) and converted some comms between the main and renderer processes to a more robust approach using `invoke/handle`. This is a first step towards isolating all Node-related calls, so that Node integration can be turned off for the main UI code.

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

Most of the work has been dedicated to updating UI code, testing and fixing bugs after the massive upgrade to the new storage backend and the new API.

- updated [About Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2378) copy
- added proposal's token to email notification [subject](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1417)
- consistently handle [short](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2365) proposal tokens across the UI codebase
- fixed multiple [comment](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2384)-related UI bugs
- fixed [flickering](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2395) during initial UI loading
- ~2 other backend and ~14 UI bug fixes
- fixed [unit](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2364) and [end-to-end](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2383) tests to sync with the new API
- dependency upgrades, code cleanup, API enhancement

Contractor Management System (CMS):

- change invoice peer review [visibility](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1351) from based on author's domain to based on invoice's line items domains. This will allow contractors to review all billed work in their domain even if it is coming from contractors in other domains. The current domains are: Development, Research, Design and Marketing.
- added more email [notifications](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1353): "Timely submission of invoices will be much more important once the payout from the treasury is fully automated, so further nagging is due."
- docs update and code cleanup
- ~4 backend and ~1 UI bug fixes

Politeia v1.0.1 has been [released](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.0.1) including all the above backend fixes and improvements.

Progress towards v1.1.0 can now be tracked on the [Milestones](https://github.com/decred/politeia/milestones) page.

<a id="vspd" />

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- added block explorer [links](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/247) for ticket and fee transactions to the UI
- added best block [height](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/254) to status response (useful for detecting stalled VSPs)
- populate ticket [purchase height](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/250) for all confirmed tickets and show it on the admin page
- added a framework for database [upgrades](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/242)
- improved logging when [recovering](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/255) from request handling failures
- added [config](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/249) params for max log size and max log files to keep
- [remove](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/260) confirmed fee transactions from the database, cutting disk usage [by ~2x](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/243#issuecomment-844945549)
- store each ticket in its own [DB bucket](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/243). Combined with the previous optimization, it allows to trade ~40% more disk usage for ~50% faster insertion and ~85% faster counting of tickets.

<a id="dcrstakepool" />

**[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool)**

- fixed [incompatibility](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/636) between dcrstakepool (legacy VSP software) and dcrwallet v1.6.3 in some [rare](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/139#issuecomment-843101864) configurations

<a id="dcrpool" />

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- do not try to run with database version [newer](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/326) than expected
- handle `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` shutdown [signals](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/327)
- fixed chain notifications getting [blocked](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/324) by payment processing and added a workaround for dcrwallet's [reorg handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1740) bug

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

DCRDEX v0.2.0 has been released! It incorporates more than 3 months of work since the v0.1.5 release. Most notable changes:

- UI and usability enhancements including responsive design and interactive depth chart

## Governance

{ we need to revise how we report to cover both legacy and new Treasury. maybe just sum them for a start? }

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using May's average of ${n.nn}, this is ${n} received and ${n} spent. At April's average rate of $198.60, the USD billed for past work is ${n}. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: May's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by vspd servers and {} (-{}) by the [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed {}% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout May there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of {date} [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) ({} total, dcrd only): { vX.Y.Z - n%, ... }

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

How exchanges handled Decred's 6th consensus upgrade on May 8:

- Binance had no issues { someone please confirm }
- Bittrex got stuck at block [552447](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/552447) - by coincidence it is the last block on the old consensus rules. Their [status page](https://global.bittrex.com/Status) reported that DCR wallet is disabled and under "Wallet Maintenance" until at least May 13 { update the finish date }.
- Poloniex [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PoloSupport/status/1390916088397852675) that their DCR wallet has been disabled for "maintenance" that lasted until at least May 13 { update the finish date }.
- { did DCRDEX have any downtime? :D }
- { any info on other exchanges? }
