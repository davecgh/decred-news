## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Explicit Version Upgrades consensus change ([DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)):

- new consensus rules have been [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2716). Once activated, unknown transaction and script versions will be rejected until they have explicitly been enabled by another consensus change. Coins that were spendable before activation will remain spendable. This change will provide greater network security and allow developers to write more bug-proof code, as explained in [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) comments, [DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki), or a recent dev [discussion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2719#issuecomment-909535320).
- @davecgh posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861/comments/21) that all dcrd development work is complete

Automatic Ticket Revocations consensus change ([DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)):

- [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2718): added tests, added agenda definitions, reorganized code to fit upcoming changes. A new transaction priority was introduced to ensure automatic revocations are always created. Full list of priorities becomes: votes (highest) > automatic revocations > tickets > regular transactions and revocations (lowest).
- [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2720) the actual consensus change. Once activated, blocks will be required to contain revocations for all tickets that become missed or expired as of that block. New rules will also allow to unlock some [~200K DCR](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/e2d7b7d/docs/unrevoked-missed-tickets.md) that got stuck in unrevoked missed tickets.
- @rstaudt2 posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d/comments/19) that all dcrd development work is complete

Other merged work:

- implemented spend journal [pruning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2641) that delays removal of spend journal entries until they are no longer used (this is needed for [asynchronous indexing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1470) that will speed up block validation) { is description and motivation correct? }
- added more tests for address manager and [decoupled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2596) it from `wire` package, in preparation for upcoming changes in the wire protocol
- pinned [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2735) images and GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2736) with hashes instead of tags for better supply chain security
- reworked [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2740) support to provide an image with strong focus on security. It will only include Decred-specific binaries ("distroless") and run them as an unprivileged user. The new final image is around 10 MB, compared to ~1 GB for the existing version.
- code upgraded to use [Go 1.16](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2722) features
- updated module [hierarchy](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2744) graph

> Huge dcrd release brewing... including 3 consensus votes, ~30% faster syncing, and much more. ([@rstaudt2](https://twitter.com/rstaudt2/status/1443668800679858181))

## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,274 DCR worth $1.4M at September's average rate of $139.56. 590 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $82K at September's rate, or $95K at August's billing rate of $161.24. As of Oct 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 723,528 DCR (83.5 million USD at $115.45).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity. 18 DCR received, looks like change }

{ high level recap of decision-making activity and most important events }

Two new proposals were submitted, both by @raedah, requesting renewed funding for [GoDCR](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) and [Mobile Wallets](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e).

Voter participation reached new heights, with both of the votes this month seeing turnout above the previous record level.

- The PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) from was approved with 97.5% approval and a turnout of 75%.
- The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/150cf81) to fund an educational video series for the Indian market, from @finstreet21, was rejected with 45% approval and turnout of 77%.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~354.7 Ph/s and closed ~228.1 Ph/s, bottoming at 189.5 Ph/s and peaking at 448.9 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Oct 1: Poolin 35.5%, F2Pool 25%, AntPool 22%, BTC.com 4.95%, Luxor 2.97%, HuobiPool 1.15%, CoinMine 0.15%, OKEx 0.13%.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 192.8-210.8 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 199.40 DCR (+5.6).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.69-8.16 million DCR, meaning that 57.7-61.05% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

Ticket prices seem to have hit a relative plateau between two extremes. 

**VSP**: On Oct 1, 7623 (-v) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and 216 (-34) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 8 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed 19.2% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout September there were around 204 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Oct 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (257 dcrd nodes): v1.6.2 - 55.25%, v1.6.0 - 12.45%, v1.6.1 - 11.67%, v1.7 dev builds - 13.61%, v1.6 dev builds - 2.72%, v1.5.2 - 1.94%, v1.5.1 - 1.16%.

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

Sushi's Miso app was [exploited](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/3m-in-ether-stolen-from-sushiswaps-miso-launchpad/) to steal the proceeds of an NFT drop ($3m for Kia Sedonas from Jay Pegs Auto Mart). The attacker was [identified](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/17/3m-was-stolen-but-the-real-steal-is-these-kia-sedonas-say-anonymous-developers/) (through their use of ENS domain) as a Sushi developer, who had inserted code into the front end which would send funds to their own address. The funds were subsequently returned.

The Compound DeFi app deployed new smart contracts which [gave](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/) away $80M worth of COMP tokens in unintended ways. Founder Robert Leshner asked recipients to send the tokens back, and described it as a moral [dilemma](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/01/compound-founder-says-80m-bug-presents-moral-dilemma-for-defi-users/), after initially intimating that people who don't give the tokens back could have their details passed to tax collection authorities. One interesting aspect of the story is that the problem was identified quite quickly, but because changing the contracts requires a governance process there was no way to deploy a quick fix and all of the vulnerable funds were drained.
