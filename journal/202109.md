## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,274 DCR worth $1.4M at September's average rate of $139.56. 590 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $82K at September's rate, or $95K at August's billing rate of $161.24. As of Oct 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 723,528 DCR (83.5 million USD at $115.45).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity. 18 DCR received, looks like change }

{ high level recap of decision-making activity and most important events }

Two new proposals were submitted, both by @raedah, requesting renewed funding for [GoDCR](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) and [Mobile Wallets](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e).

Voter participation reached new heights, with both of the votes this month seeing turnout above the previous record level.

- The PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) from Monde was approved with 97.5% approval and turnout of 75%.
- The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/150cf81) to fund an educational video series for the Indian market, from @finstreet21, was rejected with 45% approval and turnout of 77%.

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~354.7 Ph/s and closed ~228.1 Ph/s, bottoming at 189.5 Ph/s and peaking at 448.9 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Oct 1: Poolin 35.5%, F2Pool 25%, AntPool 22%, BTC.com 4.95%, Luxor 2.97%, HuobiPool 1.15%, CoinMine 0.15%, OKEx 0.13%.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 192.8-210.8 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 199.40 DCR (+5.6).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.69-8.16 million DCR, meaning that 57.7-61.05% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.
