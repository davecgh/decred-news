## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Explicit Version Upgrades consensus change ([DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)):

- new consensus rules have been [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2716). Once activated, unknown transaction and script versions will be rejected until they have explicitly been enabled by another consensus change. Coins that were spendable before activation will remain spendable. This change will provide greater network security and allow developers to write more bug-proof code, as mentioned in [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) comments, [DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki), or a recent dev [discussion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2719#issuecomment-909535320).
- @davecgh posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861/comments/21) that all development work is complete

Automatic Ticket Revocations consensus change ([DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)):

- [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2718): added tests, added agenda definitions, reorganized code to fit upcoming changes. A new transaction priority was introduced to ensure automatic revocations are always created. Full list of priorities becomes: votes (highest) > automatic revocations > tickets > regular transactions and revocations (lowest).
- [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2720) the actual consensus change. Once activated, it will allow tickets to be revoked by anyone, and blocks will be required to contain revocations for all tickets that become missed or expired as of that block.
- @rstaudt2 posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d/comments/19) that the Decred Change Proposal and code changes have been completed

Other merged work:

- implemented spend journal [pruning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2641) that delays removal of spend journal entries until they are no longer used (this is needed for [asynchronous indexing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1470) that will speed up block validation) { is description and motivation correct? }
- added more tests for address manager and [decoupled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2596) it from `wire` package, in preparation for upcoming changes in the wire protocol
- pinned [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2735) images and GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2736) with hashes instead of tags for better supply chain security
- reworked [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2740) support to provide an image with a strong focus on security: runs as a non-root user and only includes Decred-specific binaries ("distroless"). The new final image is around 10 MB.
- code upgraded to use [Go 1.16](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2722) features
- updated module [hierarchy](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2744) graph

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

Another feature and bugfix release has landed on [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/) website! Highlights of v1.2.0:

- proposal author updates for approved proposals
- select any two versions to compare
- embed image button
- optimistic instant comment vote updates
- server: proposal billing statuses to formalize whether billing is allowed or not
- server: unified proposal status to simplify clients
- server: increased security and stability

For more details check the release notes in [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and [politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/releases/tag/v1.2.0) repositories.

User-facing changes merged in September:

- integrated new proposal [statuses](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2609) and admin ability to set billing status
- improved UX of [embedding images](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2567)
- show login modal when user session [expires](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2541)
- added [SEO meta tags](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2614) to improve appearance of search results for "decred politeia", and also provide nice previews on Twitter and Facebook posts
- updated dark mode [toggle](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2588) design
- ~18 GUI bug fixes and ~3 enhancements

Backend, internal, and command-line changes:

- added high-level interfaces for [file system checks](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1512) to verify data integrity and rebuild caches on startup. [Implementations](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1511) for individual components will be done separately.
- added unified [proposal status](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1515) that serves as a single source for proposal metadata from different plugins, thus removing complexity from clients and also reducing the load on server. The new status can be queried with `proposalsummaries` command of the `pictl` tool.
- implemented cache rebuild for the [record inventory](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1520) when file system check is enabled with `--fsck`
- added option to save vote results output of the `pictl` command [as CSV](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1478)
- added read and write [timeouts](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1505) for both `politeiad` and `politeiawww` servers
- added [page sizes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1518) to policy responses, to be used on the GUI
- refactored middleware in [`politeiad`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1507) and [`politeiawww`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1506) servers and added read limits for client requests and WebSocket messages
- added documentation: [exported API](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1497) docs, [plugin](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1519) system overview, and writing [E2E tests](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2591)
- fixed a memory [leak](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1500)
- ~4 other backend bug fixes
- increased backend and end-to-end UI test coverage

## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,274 DCR worth $1.4M at September's average rate of $139.56. 590 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $82K at September's rate, or $95K at August's billing rate of $161.24. As of Oct 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 723,528 DCR (83.5 million USD at $115.45).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity. 18 DCR received, looks like change }

{ high level recap of decision-making activity and most important events }

Two new proposals were submitted, both by @raedah, requesting renewed funding for [GoDCR](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) and [Mobile Wallets](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e).

Voter participation reached new heights, with both of the votes this month seeing turnout above the previous record level.

- The PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) from Monde was approved with 97.5% approval and a turnout of 75%.
- The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/150cf81) to fund an educational video series for the Indian market, from @finstreet21, was rejected with 45% approval and turnout of 77%.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~354.7 Ph/s and closed ~228.1 Ph/s, bottoming at 189.5 Ph/s and peaking at 448.9 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Oct 1: Poolin 35.5%, F2Pool 25%, AntPool 22%, BTC.com 4.95%, Luxor 2.97%, HuobiPool 1.15%, CoinMine 0.15%, OKEx 0.13%.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 192.8-210.8 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 199.40 DCR (+5.6).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.69-8.16 million DCR, meaning that 57.7-61.05% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

Ticket prices seem to have hit a relative plateau between two extremes. 

**VSP**: On Oct 1, 7623 (-v) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and 216 (-34) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 8 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed 19.2% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout September there were around 204 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Oct 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (257 dcrd nodes): v1.6.2 - 55.25%, v1.6.0 - 12.45%, v1.6.1 - 11.67%, v1.7 dev builds - 13.61%, v1.6 dev builds - 2.72%, v1.5.2 - 1.94%, v1.5.1 - 1.16%.

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.
