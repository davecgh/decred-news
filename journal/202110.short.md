Hello Instagram!

Decred Journal is here to bring you a detailed report of October's development, governance, network, new media content, and more.

Highlights:

- The network has served 600,000 blocks without major hacks, rug pulls, or newsworthy drama. Nothing to see here!

- Politeia celebrated three years of operation. Average voter turnout increased significantly with 46% in year three, compared to 28% in year two. 20 proposals have been approved, mostly for software development, and mostly from existing contractors. 11 proposals got rejected.

- The mobile wallets proposal from raedah was funded for another year. The GoDCR desktop wallet proposal was rejected but a revised proposal is being prepared.

- Changes merged in DCRDEX make it possible to pay registration fees in BTC too (in addition to DCR) and trade with a built-in light wallet without running a Bitcoin full node.

That should do it for a super quick Instagram intro. Hardcore followers, make your 2 cups of coffee and read the full report:

And for the minimalists out there here's a version with light pages and no tracking:

P.S. Let us know in comments if Instagram announcements work better for you than Twitter/Reddit/etc and if we should keep making them.
