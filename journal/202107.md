## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- updated the `UtxoBackend` implementation to use `leveldb` directly rather than using the `database` package. This results in ~10% faster initial blockchain download and ~12% reduced memory usage.
- block index changed to use [short keys](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2685), resulting in ~30 MiB memory savings
- added size [limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2675) for RPC requests to help further harden the server against potential abuse in non-standard configurations on poorly-configured networks
- added a more strict [origin check](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2676) for WebSocket connections
- smaller fixes and cleanup

At this point we have 3 upcoming consensus changes at different stages of development:

- reverting to the originally-proposed treasury expenditure policy (to [fix spending](202106.md#new-treasury-bug) from the new treasury) has a draft [DCP](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/20) and a draft [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680)
- explicit version upgrades has an approved [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680) and some support code already merged (like the standard script handling we covered [in June](202106.md#dcrd))
- automatic ticket revocations has an approved [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- added an RPC method that will allow Decrediton to discover active addresses more efficiently
- added an RPC method to [revoke](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2061) tickets in SPV mode (also for Decrediton)
- fixed concurrency issues when [unlocking](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2067) the wallet

## Governance

In July the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 11,338 DCR worth $1.44M at July's average rate of $127.48. 770 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $98K at July's rate, or $101K at June's billing rate of $131.52. As of Aug 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 703,655 DCR (96.3 million USD at $136.80).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity rr: there are some bits of DCR arriving at it, including what look like outputs from votes... quite [strange](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/2411c14283d5810e0d7f6d1f174e42cb4cf536fb2f7dd51b96d63c9087766e10/in/13)}

There were 4 new proposals published in July, and three are still under discussion at time of writing.

* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae609f1) from @frizzers to make a copyleft documentary film that can be freely shared, based on his book "Daylight Robbery", at a cost of $300K.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/51c4128) to fund people at attend Crypto Expo Dubai in October 2021 has presented two options, costing $21,240 to fly 4 Decred representatives in to Dubai for the conference, or $26,240 to also pay for a presentation slot at the event. @sz1 will choose one option based on community feedback.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/a3fa55f) to fund a 3 part science fiction miniseries has been withdrawn by its owner.
* Proposals were approved for the Automatic Tickets Revocations Consensus [Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) (95% approval, 51% participation) and a Twitter [bot](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2895755) (85% approval, 46% turnout).

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: July's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~71.4 Ph/s and closed ~316.3 Ph/s, bottoming at 70.29 Ph/s and peaking at 334 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Aug 1: Poolin 58.11%, F2Pool 23.2%, Antpool 6.41%, BTC.com 4.29%, Easy2mine 4.09%, Luxor 2.32%, Huobipool 0.92%, ViaBTC 0.365%,Coinmine 0.09%, okex 0.081%, UUPool 0.063%.

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-true) varied between 203.2-146.3 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 190.65 DCR (+5.95).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.43-7.87 million DCR, meaning that 56.29-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by vspd servers and {} (-{}) by the [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed 59.79% of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout July there were around 211 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Aug 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (250): v1.6.2 - 56.8%, v1.6.0 - 16.4%, v1.6.1 - 12.8%, v1.7 dev builds - 6.8%, v1.6 dev builds - 2.8%, v1.5.2 - 2%, v1.5.1 - 1.6%.

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.
