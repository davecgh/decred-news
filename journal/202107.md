## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- updated the `UtxoBackend` implementation to use `leveldb` directly rather than using the `database` package. This results in ~10% faster initial blockchain download and ~12% reduced memory usage.
- block index changed to use [short keys](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2685), resulting in ~30 MiB memory savings
- added size [limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2675) for RPC requests to help further harden the server against potential abuse in non-standard configurations on poorly-configured networks
- added a more strict [origin check](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2676) for WebSocket connections
- smaller fixes and cleanup

At this point we have 3 upcoming consensus changes at different stages of development:

- reverting to the originally-proposed treasury expenditure policy (to [fix spending](202106.md#new-treasury-bug) from the new treasury) has a draft [DCP](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/20) and a draft [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680)
- explicit version upgrades has an approved [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2680) and some support code already merged (like the standard script handling we covered [in June](202106.md#dcrd))
- automatic ticket revocations has an approved [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- added an RPC method that will allow Decrediton to discover active addresses more efficiently
- added an RPC method to [revoke](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2061) tickets in SPV mode (also for Decrediton)
- fixed concurrency issues when [unlocking](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2067) the wallet

<a id="decrediton" />

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

User-facing:

- handle attempts to register with [insufficient balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1092)
- log [swap refund](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1110) transactions so that the user can salvage funds when access to the client is lost but the logs are still available

- show order errors [on the form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1093) instead of the notification bell
- 4+ bug fixes

Internal:

- only allow one [preimage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1106) request on the client to protect against malicious server behavior

- 4+ bug fixes

Ethereum support:

- bare bones client-side [ETH](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1005) infrastructure (mainnet use disabled for now)
- store ETH balance in [gwei](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1078) units to fit 64-bit integers
- implemented ETH [sync status](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1082) and fee rate information (with a workaround, missing Geth feature [requested](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/23099))

A few fixes have been [backported](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/release-v0.2) to an upcoming v0.2.1 release.

Work started to replace the registration fee with [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1120) where users lock funds to use DCRDEX (as a [disincentive](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1412061031061508098) against bad behavior) but can redeem them after a certain time. This creates a time cost to use DCRDEX instead of a monetary cost.

## Governance

In July the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 11,338 DCR worth $1.44M at July's average rate of $127.48. 770 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $98K at July's rate, or $101K at June's billing rate of $131.52. As of Aug 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new treasury is 703,655 DCR (96.3 million USD at $136.80).

{ check the legacy treasury for any activity rr: there are some bits of DCR arriving at it, including what look like outputs from votes... quite [strange](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/2411c14283d5810e0d7f6d1f174e42cb4cf536fb2f7dd51b96d63c9087766e10/in/13)}

There were 4 new proposals published in July, and three are still under discussion at time of writing.

- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae609f1) from @frizzers to make a copyleft documentary film that can be freely shared, based on his book "Daylight Robbery", at a cost of $300K.
- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/51c4128) to fund people at attend Crypto Expo Dubai in October 2021 has presented two options, costing $21,240 to fly 4 Decred representatives in to Dubai for the conference, or $26,240 to also pay for a presentation slot at the event. @sz1 will choose one option based on community feedback.
- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/a3fa55f) to fund a 3 part science fiction miniseries has been withdrawn by its owner.
- Proposals were approved for the Automatic Tickets Revocations Consensus [Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) (95% approval, 51% participation) and a Twitter [bot](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2895755) (85% approval, 46% turnout).

## Network

**Hashrate**: July's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~71 Ph/s and closed ~316 Ph/s, bottoming at 70 Ph/s and peaking at 334 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Aug 1: Poolin 58%, F2Pool 23%, AntPool 6%, BTC.com 4%, Easy2Mine 4%, Luxor 2.3%, HuobiPool 1%, ViaBTC 0.4%, CoinMine 0.09%, OKEx 0.08%, UUPool 0.06%. Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before Aug 1 closely matched the reported hashrate.

Hashrate is recovering from June's [events](https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-bitcoin-mining-crackdown-is-a-boon-for-miners-elsewhere) in China and new mining pools join the network.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 146.3-203.2 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 190.7 DCR (+6).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.43-7.88 million DCR, meaning that 56.3-59.8% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kqhwurpw-kru2wj65&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

Ticket price had an unusual drop below 2020 lows but later recovered with a strong buy support.

**VSP**: On Aug 1, ~8,600 (+600) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and ~400 (-200) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 11 legacy and 14 new VSPs managed 22.9% (+2%) of the ticket pool. Unlisted but still active legacy VSPs managed 12 live tickets (-14).

Biggest ticket gainers in absolute terms were stakey.com (+474), 123.dcr.rocks (+126) and ubiqsmart.com (+51). The first two have fees below 0.5%.

**Nodes**: Throughout July there were around 211 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Aug 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (250): v1.6.2 - 57%, v1.6.0 - 16%, v1.6.1 - 13%, v1.7 dev builds - 7%, v1.6 dev builds - 3%, v1.5.2 - 2%, v1.5.1 - 1.6%.

Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen 36 nodes (+2), 66 channels (+6) with a total capacity of 25.5 DCR (+3.7), as of Aug 1.

## Ecosystem

Welcome the new vspd instance [dcrvsp.dittrex.com](https://dcrvsp.dittrex.com/), coming to replace their legacy VSP which was [delisted](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/140) in May and shutdown in July.

Legacy VSP [pool.d3c.red](https://pool.d3c.red) from @karamble voted its final ticket and was shutdown. Users are welcome to use the replacement server [vsp.decredcommunity.org](https://vsp.decredcommunity.org/).

So far 8 legacy VSPs have been delisted (3 shutdown, 1 status unknown, 4 still voting) and 9 are still listed. The status of migration to the new [VSP system](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/) is summarized in [this table](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/231#issuecomment-774877129). It is [recommended](https://twitter.com/JamieHoldstock/status/1405069123453784065) that legacy VSP users upgrade to vspd to avoid the risk of missed tickets when dcrstakepool stops working (e.g. if a new consensus upgrade is activated).

The [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/) has been updated to show the percentage of revoked tickets, which is a helpful metric when choosing a VSP.

[ViaBTC](https://www.viabtc.com/) announced the [launch](https://viabtc.medium.com/viabtc-pool-unveils-dcr-on-chain-co-governance-under-hybrid-consensus-61fcbd133a55) of DCR mining, celebrated by a "Fee-free Mining Carnival" until Aug 25. The pool supports PPS+, PPLNS and SOLO payment [methods](https://support.viabtc.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403972374297-DCR-Mining-Pool-Launched-Mine-with-ZERO-Fees-For-30-days).

[OKEx pool](https://www.okex.com/pool) has DCR mining since [Aug 2020](https://www.okex.com/academy/en/how-to-earn-cryptocurrency-with-okex-pool) or earlier, but only in July it got some blocks mined according to [miningpoolstats.stream](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred).

[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) [pre-announced](https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1421032832848302081) DCR trading and then [posted](https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1423210403774009345) that DCR/USD trading has started.
