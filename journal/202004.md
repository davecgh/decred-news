April's highlights:

- The optimizations continue for dcrd, which got so much faster it got banned by older versions and the banning criteria have to be updated.
- @moo31337 published a WIP PR for the work on decentralization of Treasury spending.
- We welcome 5 new contributors to the Decred GitHub repositories!
- It's been a big month for integrations, with the gateways Transak and Metal Pay. Steelbackup (metal DCR seed storage solution) also added a new budget option.
- In-person events are off, but virtual events are way up, especially in Latam!

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- more parts of the codebase migrated from Go's standard big integers to specialized field types, making significant performance improvements
- `schnorr` package: improvements to safety, testing, and performance, as well as a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/dcrec/secp256k1/schnorr/README.md) describing the custom Schnorr-based signature scheme used in Decred

> A Schnorr signature is a digital signature scheme that is known for its simplicity, provable security, and efficient generation of short signatures. It provides many advantages over ECDSA signatures that make them ideal for use with the only real downside being that they are not well standardized at the time of this writing.

While the consensus supports Schnorr signatures, the rest of the infrastructure needed to fully take advantage of their benefits is not well fleshed out, and therefore they are not in widespread use yet. The goal is to remedy that.

With all the recent work, ECDSA and Schnorr signature verification is around [25% faster](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$15862341309060voZvJ:decred.org) compared to v1.5.1.

Lots of optimizations in dcrd made over the past months have led to a "suffering from success" [meme](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1248522626210897921): older nodes now think the new version is requesting too much data too quickly and [banning](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$158650272611269MJQhM:decred.org) it. The "banning rate" parameters will have to be adjusted to reflect the new speeds.

The dcrd repository is no longer configured as a fork of [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd). So many new features have been added and overall improvements made that there is very little code still in common between them. Also, one of the primary reasons for having a fork is to be able to pull in upstream changes easily. That is not the case anymore though because the code is so different that any changes desired for dcrd would effectively have to be ported anyway. And even then, most changes made in btcd simply don't apply to dcrd anymore. The "unforking" also removes the confusion about the fork count where dcrd page showed the number of all forks of btcd (1,500+). Now it shows 235 forks for dcrd and 1,290 for btcd. Finally, it removes the annoyance and a chance for error where pressing "New pull request" would open a PR against the upstream btcd repository with all the changes on Decred's master branch.

The `dcrctl` command-line app that controls dcrd and dcrwallet was split out of dcrd into its own [repository](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) to address dependency and maintenance [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2133).

In progress:

- Decentralize Treasury Spending [development](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) work was published to make it more visible and let more people join the discussion. The work is based on the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) but adds significant changes to the spec.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- new [`addtransaction`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1712) command that will be particularly useful for the upcoming ticket-based VSP design
- bug fixes and code maintenance
- dcrwallet is no longer a fork of [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) for the same reasons as dcrd and has 137 of its own forks as of writing

In progress:

- Decentralized Treasury Spending [support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1714) for the wallet corresponding to the work in dcrd.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- [first](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2448) [steps](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2449) to migrate to functional components (a newer [approach](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-functional-components/) in the React framework - they are easier to reason about and test)
- new action to [abandon transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2467) that are not being mined or got "stuck"
- [started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2457) reusing the pi-ui library for several components in order to have consistent look & feel across Decred's different products
- first [steps](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2452) towards [CSPP support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2455)

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- new [method](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1137) to query invoice line items that have been billed to the given proposal
- [separated](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1175) metadata out of Politeia proposals and CMS invoices - this removes a hacky way to store proposal title that was used previously and allows to add arbitrary metadata, including the fields required by the RFP proposals
- part of the work to allow viewing Politeia [without javascript](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1833)
- normalized and added [caching](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1844) for paywall data
- [finished](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1857) the [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/1490) of the state management system
- a batch of UI work to support [RFP proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1820)
- several UI tweaks for the CMS
- multiple bug fixes in Politeia and CMS

- dependency updates and bug fixes

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

- added [cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/180), which improved the data flow (the hub now pushes new data into the cache instead of the GUI polling for it)
- added pagination in several places - this completes work on the [proper UI](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/issues/146) as provided by the designers
- configurable [account](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/191) for paying rewards from
- added GUI to [request a payment](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/198) manually and clear any remaining balance (useful when leaving the pool)
- increased test coverage

## Governance

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,250 DCR and spent 17,228 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of $12.34, this is $164K received and $213K spent. At March's average daily rate of $13.40, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $231K. As of May 3, Treasury balance is 636,000 DCR (9.17 million USD at $14.42).

Two new proposals were submitted in April, [one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bce7bf3cd1f74d571d23ac8a330ddf29a14a547ed0cc9c995f1a97dce733d1e1) for a billboard marketing campaign was rejected with 17% approval (31% turnout) and [another](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/83b59ef5ab40193a86073abbd93cea13ed6d071eecc78918ab5cf98cba7c7a67) from CryptoNoticias for a content marketing campaign was also rejected with 31% approval and 30% turnout.

The two proposals from March voted on this month were also rejected. [DCR Comic 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2f08f8518bc7672069a10ac6461fd9ab341d4a9e4c343fd4a7ec426250f3896f) had support from 49.4% of the tickets that voted (participation of 19%), while the [Decred Daily](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7d42c6f4bf3059b64789185af615c1df97cb61a379425933be5ff01d074ed4d5) proposal had 44% approval from the 17% of eligible tickets that voted. Both did not reach the quorum of 20% votes.

## Network

Hashrate: [April's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~302 Ph/s and closed ~360 Ph/s, bottoming at 240 Ph/s and peaking at 470 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of May 1: UUPool 46%, Poolin 22%, lab.antpool.com 17%, F2Pool 2%, Luxor 2%, BTC.com 1.6%, BeePool 0.12%, CoinMine 0.05%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~9%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 137.8 DCR (-4.1). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 131.7-142.8 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 5.62-5.71 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.2-50.3% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

Nodes: Throughout [April](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1585699200000&to=1588291200000) there was an average of 131 public listening nodes and 206 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for Apr: 44% dcrd v1.5.1, 16% dcrd v1.5, 6% dcrd v1.6 dev builds, 5% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 4% dcrd v1.4, 9% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 2.4% dcrwallet v1.4, 1.4% dcrwallet v1.5.

Updates from @Checkmate:

- Decred section of the [Our Network](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-15) newsletter ([tweet](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1247649984473894912)). Multiple metrics based on @Checkmate's Stock-to-Flow model, PoW miner income, and @permabullnino's ticket data research, signal that the network is undervalued.
- Substantial on-chain volume relative to network valuation, [NVT and RVT](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1252754120345182210) metrics.
- Increasing [transaction volumes](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1255084712386654209) due to increased privacy usage.

## Integrations

[dcr.blue](https://dcr.blue/) VSP announced that it will shut down in a message sent to all users with verified email on Apr 20. It was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/97) from the [listing](https://www.decred.org/vsp/) and Decrediton but will stay online for the rest of 2020. Since the maximum lifetime of a ticket is roughly 4.7 months, this gives users around 3 months to stop buying tickets assigned to DCR.Blue. Users are advised to backup their redeem scripts if they haven't already (a copy is available in the VSP account) and start buying tickets to a different VSP. Please avoid joining too large VSPs to maintain a healthy distribution and better security for the network. This is the first VSP to attempt a "graceful shutdown" rather than just disappearing without notice as some other VSPs have done in the past.

[decred.raqamiya.net](https://decred.raqamiya.net/) VSP that was [delisted](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/95) in March is now again operational and was [added back](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/96) to the listing. As of writing, it holds about 330 live tickets (0.8%), has 4 servers, and features a custom UI.

Metal Pay [added](https://twitter.com/metalpaysme/status/1249745420206686208) [support](https://blog.metalpay.com/metal-pay-welcomes-decred/) for DCR on their marketplace. It provides another fiat onramp and works in most US states. They followed the announcement with [tweets](https://twitter.com/metalpaysme/status/1250424090172612615) about Decred.

[Transak](https://global.transak.com/) [announced](https://twitter.com/transak_finance/status/1256654711412776961) that trading DCR against EUR, GBP and INR is [available](https://global.transak.com/?defaultCryptoCurrency=DCR) on their fiat < > crypto payment gateway. USD pairs are coming soon.

An instant exchange [SwapSpace](https://swapspace.co/) [added](https://twitter.com/SwapSpaceCo/status/1250078395884539906) support for Decred.

[Steelbackup](https://steelbackup.com/), a physical seed backup solution added a [light version](https://twitter.com/steelbackup/status/1248058631523905538) of the product. Currently, there are two types of steel plates: [laser engraved](https://steelbackup.com/product/decred-laser-engraved/) and [laser marked](https://steelbackup.com/product/decred-laser-marked/). The engraved one is the most robust solution as steel is removed which makes the marking grid as permanent as the steel. The laser marked product is marked with a molybdenum disulfide solution which makes it resistant to scratches, acids, and high temperatures (up to 340 degrees C). The products are designed to be simple with no moving parts, users just need a center punch (found at a local hardware store) to indent their seed. Tamper evident bags are included. SteelBackup was launched in Feb 2020 by @zubair and ships worldwide.

[Another](https://www.coindesk.com/dforce-hacker-returns-almost-all-of-stolen-25m-in-crypto) DeFi attack occurred, although this time dForce got most of its lost $25 million back from the attacker and users are being reimbursed.

On the more obscure stablecoin network [PegNet](https://www.coindesk.com/miners-trick-stablecoin-protocol-pegnet-turning-11-into-almost-7m-hoard), rogue miners turned a $11 pJYP balance into a 6.7 million pUSD balance by manipulating price oracles with a form of 51% attack. The attackers were unable to liquidate more than a small proportion of the pUSD, and have subsequently reached out to say they were just trying to pen test the network, and have burned the magically created pUSD.
