## Translating DJ

1\. Check the [index page](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) to see if translation to your language already exists.

If it does exist but you don't like it, feel free to submit improvements to the author of that translation. If that doesn't work out, you can always create your own translation and compete with the existing one.

All competing translations will be accepted to the [mirrors page](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/mirrors.html), but we will need some way to choose the best one for the [index page](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/).

2\. Ideally, wait for the original DJ document to be finished and released before starting to translate it.

3\. Pick the raw Markdown file in the [journal](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/tree/master/journal) directory of the `master` branch.

Before you start translating, make note of the Git branch and revision of the original document that you translate. It will help to track changes to the source document.

4\. Translations are encouraged to follow our [Typography](guidelines.md#typography) guidelines, but are free to diverge and adapt to standards of their language.

5\. Try to get at least one reviewer for your translation to ensure high quality.

6\. Add people who worked on the translation to the separate credits line at the bottom, for example:

> Credits (alphabetical order):
> 
> - writing and editing: a, b, c
> - reviews and feedback: d, e, f
> - title image: g
> - funding: Decred stakeholders
> - Spanish translation: h, i, j

7\. State whether the translation is full or partial. If partial, note what was covered or what was omitted. Put this note at the start of the document.

8\. Pick the image for your target publication platform in the [decred-journal-files](https://github.com/xaur/decred-journal-files) repository. You can even link it directly (but it will be in English). Let us know if you need a format that is not there.

9\. When finished and published, submit your translation for listing in the global [index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md) of Decred translations.

The easiest way to do it is to post the link in the [#translations](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#translations:decred.org) chat.

The global [index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md) file is the master source from which DJ's [index](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) and [mirrors](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/mirrors.html) pages will be updated.

10\. Consider mirroring your translations in a GitHub repository. This will allow easy replication, increase censorship resistance and give other benefits (see [Why Git?](guidelines.md#why-git)). For example, see [Arabic](https://github.com/Insaf01/decred-journal-ar), [Chinese](https://github.com/DominicTing/DecredCNJournal) or [Spanish](https://github.com/DecredES/traducciones/tree/master/revista-decred) repositories. If you take this route, consider our [Git workflow](guidelines.md#git-workflow). If you need help with Git or GitHub, ask @bee for an invite to #git\_help Matrix room.

11\. Coordinate with writers and other translators in [#translations](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#translations:decred.org). Share your experiences: how long it took to make the translation, how big is your audience, what parts of DJ do they find more or less valuable.
