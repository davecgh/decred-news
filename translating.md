## Translating DJ

1\. Check the [index page](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) to see if translation to your language already exists. If it does exist but you don't like it, feel free to submit improvements to the author of that translation. If that somehow fails you can still create your own translation and compete with existing one.

2\. Ideally, wait for the original document to be finished and released before starting to translate it.

3\. Before you start translating, make note of the Git branch and revision of the original document that you translate. It will help to track changes to the source document.

4\. Translations are encouraged to follow our [Typography](guidelines.md#typography) guidelines, but are free to diverge and adapt to standards of their language.

5\. Try to get at least one reviewer for your translation to ensure high quality.

6\. Add people who worked on the translation to the separate credits line at the bottom, for example:

> Credits (alphabetical order):
> 
> - writing and editing: a, b, c
> - reviews and feedback: d, e, f
> - title image: g
> - Spanish translation: h, i, j

7\. Note whether the translation is full or partial. If partial, note what was covered or what was omitted. Put this note at the start or end of the document.

8\. When finished, submit your translation for listing on the [index](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) and [mirrors](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/mirrors.html) pages. Either create a [pull request](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/pulls), or create an [issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues) or let us know in the [#writers](https://matrix.to/#/!NkCFEoJGXyDMwLfgMb:decred.org) room.

9\. Consider mirroring your translations in a GitHub repository. This will allow easy replication, increase censorship resistance and give other benefits (see [Why Git?](guidelines.md#why-git)). For example, see [Arabic](https://github.com/Insaf01/decred-journal-ar), [Chinese](https://github.com/DominicTing/DecredCNJournal) or [Spanish](https://github.com/DecredES/traducciones/tree/master/revista-decred) repositories. If you take this route, consider our [Git workflow](guidelines.md#git-workflow). If you need help with Git or GitHub, ask @bee for an invite to #git\_help room.

10\. Coordinate with writers and other translators in [#writers](https://matrix.to/#/!NkCFEoJGXyDMwLfgMb:decred.org). Share your experiences: how long the translation took to make, how big is your audience, what do they find more or less valuable to translate.
